[**_Circle The Blue Dot_**](https://github.com/RockingRok/BlueDotGame) is a personal project which I have worked on which involved JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project has helped me also learn the Angular framework and learn new technologies:

  - Using AngularJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
  - Working with various data structures and coming up with several custom objects in order to come up with an elegant solution.
  - Learning the [**_BFS (Breadth-First Search)_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) algorithm from scratch and modifying it to help forge a path for the blue dot to follow.
  - Animation in CSS and JavaScript as well as learning how to work with asynchronous events interaction with AngularJS.
