# Circle The Blue Dot
By [Mikalai Shlapkou](https://github.com/RockingRok)

[**_Circle The Blue Dot_**](https://github.com/RockingRok/BlueDotGame) is a personal project which I have worked on for the duration of Summer 2016. This project has helped me learn a lot of new things about coding in Java and using new programs:

  - Using AngularJS and JavaScript.
  - Working with 1D and 2D arrays in order to help me generate the board and help the game flow.
  - Using the [**_BFS (Breadth-First Search_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) algorithm in order to help me find the closest way out of the maze.
  - Applying the queue and Point objects in order to help me facilitate finding the right path and the next move.
  - Animation and program flow, as well as events in JavaScript.

## To Play
  - Clone or download [**_Circle The Blue Dot_**](https://github.com/RockingRok/BlueDotGame) and open the index.html file which is located under app/index.html.
  - Play the game online (Coming Soon).
